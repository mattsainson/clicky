# Clicky

### Description

This is a memory game where you want to click on each image only once until all images have been clicked.
The application renders 12 images to the screen.
The user clicks on an image but not more than once to accumulate the score.
The images are then reshuffled on screen.
If a user clicks the same image twice, the game is over, and the game starts over.
If the score is higher than the high score, you get a new high score.
